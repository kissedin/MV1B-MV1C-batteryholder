# MV1B-MV1C-batteryholder
A small circuit board to replace the stock battery on Neo Geo MV1B and MV1C with a coin cell battery holder.

I've tried it with 19 and 20 mm leg space battery holder. And of course disable the charge circuit if you intend to use a non rechargeable battery.

There are two versions; one vertical and one horizontal. Both boards can be used in either direction though. Use angled pins for a vertical board.
